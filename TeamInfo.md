## Project Summary

Railroad is a web application tool for Dungeons and Dragons campaign creation and management. As D&D games involve hidden information being revealed to players by events that occur in the game, campaign creators (aka the dungeon master, or DM) write detailed descriptions for things like locations, characters, and items which have individual facts about them that are hidden from the players until the dungeon master chooses to make the information known. In most games, players wind up having to take their own notes on what is revealed to them, making for redundant effort for each player. Railroad is a tool to allow DMs to store all their notes in one places and share facts about the world they've built with players in a few simple clicks, and to enable them to reveal each fact individually without sharing its entire containing document.
